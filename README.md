# nicoproxy

This is a proxy for caching videos on nicovideo.jp

If you specify this program as proxy, it saves videos that you are going to watch or send saved video to your browser.

This program is released under the MIT License, see LICENSE.txt

To use this proxy, you have to download some libraries:
- http://trotinet.sourceforge.net/ (source code)
- http://www.newtonsoft.com/json (source code or binary, installing on visual studio is easy)

and implement a property:
- TrotiNet.HttpHeaders.Range

and build libraries.

I have reached the limits of the library this program use. so I won't develop this anymore.
